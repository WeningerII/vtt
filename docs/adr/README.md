# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use ADRs to document significant engineering decisions. ADRs are lightweight, versioned alongside code, and provide clear context, decisions, and consequences.

- Location: `docs/adr/`
- Numbering: zero-padded incremental IDs, e.g. `0001-...`
- Status values: `proposed | accepted | superseded | deprecated | rejected`
- Template: see `0000-template.md`

## Workflow

1. Draft an ADR as `proposed` and open a PR.
2. Discuss, iterate, and when agreed, mark as `accepted`.
3. If a decision is changed, create a new ADR and mark the older one `superseded`.
