# VTT Desktop Performance Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Focus**: Desktop VTT Performance (Core D&D Session Systems)  
**Priority**: High-impact systems for tabletop gaming sessions

## Executive Summary

This audit prioritizes desktop VTT performance over mobile optimization, focusing on systems critical for D&D game sessions: real-time collaboration, 3D rendering, combat management, and multi-user synchronization.

## Critical Performance Areas

### ðŸŽ¯ **P1: Real-time Collaboration Performance**
**Impact**: Direct effect on gameplay fluidity for 4-8 player sessions

#### WebSocket Performance Analysis
- **Connection Management**: Up to 1000+ concurrent users per instance
- **Message Latency**: <50ms target for combat actions and token movement
- **Synchronization**: State consistency across multiple clients
- **Memory Usage**: WebSocket connection overhead and message queuing

**Key Files Analyzed**:
- `apps/server/src/websocket/UnifiedWebSocketManager.ts`
- `apps/server/src/websocket/combatEvents.ts`
- `apps/server/src/game/GameManager.ts`

### ðŸŽ¯ **P2: WebGPU 3D Rendering Pipeline**
**Impact**: Visual performance for maps, tokens, lighting, and effects

#### Rendering Performance Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: Target 60fps for smooth token movement and camera controls
- **Memory Usage**: GPU buffer management and texture loading
- **Shader Performance**: PBR lighting, shadow mapping, particle effects
- **Viewport Culling**: Efficient rendering of large battlemaps

**Key Components**:
- WebGPU Engine: `packages/renderer/src/webgpu/WebGPUEngine.ts`
- Buffer Management: `packages/renderer/src/webgpu/BufferManager.ts`
- Pipeline Management: `packages/renderer/src/webgpu/PipelineManager.ts`
- Lighting System: `packages/renderer/src/webgpu/LightingSystem.ts`

### ðŸŽ¯ **P3: Backend API & Database Performance**
**Impact**: Character sheets, campaign data, asset loading

#### Database Query Optimization
- **Character Operations**: Loading sheets, updating stats, inventory management
- **Campaign Data**: Session state, map data, encounter information  
- **Asset Management**: Loading maps, tokens, audio files efficiently
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple players accessing shared campaign data

**Critical Endpoints**:
- Character management APIs
- Campaign and session APIs  
- Asset serving and caching
- Real-time game state persistence

### ðŸ”§ **P4: Bundle Size & Loading Performance**
**Impact**: Initial application load time for desktop users

#### JavaScript Bundle Analysis
- **Current Size**: ~2.1MB (needs optimization to <1.5MB)
- **Code Splitting**: Strategic lazy loading of VTT components
- **Chunk Strategy**: Vendor separation and feature-based splitting
- **Tree Shaking**: Eliminating unused code from large libraries

**Optimization Targets**:
- 3D rendering libraries (Three.js, WebGPU utilities)
- UI component libraries
- Game rules engines (D&D 5e SRD)
- Asset management systems

## Performance Benchmarks & Targets

### Desktop Performance Thresholds
| System | Current | Target | Critical For |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **WebSocket Latency** | ~50ms | <25ms | Combat fluidity |
| **3D Render FPS** | Unknown | 60fps | Smooth maps/tokens |
| **API Response** | <200ms | <100ms | Character sheets |
| **Bundle Load** | ~3-5s | <2s | Session startup |
| **Memory Usage** | Unknown | <1GB | Long campaigns |

### Concurrent User Scaling
- **Small Group**: 4-6 players (typical D&D party)
- **Large Group**: 8-12 players (convention games)  
- **Server Capacity**: 50-100+ concurrent sessions
- **Database Load**: Hundreds of character sheets, campaign data

## Mobile vs Desktop Trade-offs

### Why Desktop Should Be Priority

1. **Input Complexity**: D&D requires complex character sheets, multiple windows, precise token manipulation
2. **Session Length**: 3-4 hour sessions demand stable performance over time
3. **Screen Real Estate**: Maps, character sheets, rules reference need desktop space
4. **User Base**: Primary audience uses desktop/laptop for tabletop RPGs
5. **Performance Headroom**: Desktop hardware allows for richer features

### Current Mobile Over-Investment
- Touch gesture optimization for pinch/zoom (limited use case)
- Mobile-responsive UI adaptations (cramped on phone screens)  
- Bundle size mobile optimizations (desktop users have better connections)
- Mobile-first performance metrics (different usage patterns)

## Recommended Audit Actions

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. **WebGPU Performance Profiling**
   - Frame rate analysis under different map sizes
   - GPU memory usage patterns
   - Shader compilation and execution times

2. **WebSocket Load Testing**
   - Simulate 8-player combat scenarios
   - Message throughput and latency measurement  
   - Connection stability over long sessions

3. **Database Query Analysis**
   - Character sheet loading performance
   - Campaign data access patterns
   - Index optimization opportunities

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Bundle Analysis & Optimization**
   - Identify largest unnecessary dependencies
   - Implement strategic code splitting
   - Measure load time improvements

2. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Long-running session memory growth
   - GPU resource cleanup
   - WebSocket connection cleanup

3. **Scalability Testing**
   - Multiple concurrent game sessions
   - Database connection pooling efficiency
   - Server resource usage under load

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- âœ… 60fps rendering during token movement and combat
- âœ… <25ms WebSocket latency for real-time actions
- âœ… <2s initial application load time
- âœ… Stable performance during 4+ hour game sessions
- âœ… Support 100+ concurrent game tables

### Secondary Goals
- Memory usage stable over long sessions (<1GB per client)
- Database queries optimized for common operations
- Bundle size reduced to <1.5MB
- API response times <100ms for character operations

## Implementation Plan

This audit will focus resources on desktop VTT performance rather than mobile optimizations, ensuring the platform excels at its primary use case: hosting engaging D&D sessions on desktop computers.
