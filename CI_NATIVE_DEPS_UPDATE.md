# CI Native Dependencies Update

## Summary

Fixed `pngquant-bin` build failures in CI by ensuring required system packages are installed before dependency installation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Native Dependencies Action

**File**: `.github/actions/setup-native-deps/action.yml`

- Added `zlib1g-dev` to core package list alongside existing `libpng-dev`
- Now installs: `nasm yasm build-essential libpng-dev zlib1g-dev`

### 2. Fixed Performance Monitoring Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml`

- Added `Setup native dependencies` step before timed `pnpm install`
- Fixed invalid context reference: `env.install_duration_seconds` → `steps.install_deps.outputs.install_duration_seconds`

### 3. Verified Other Workflows

All other workflows already use `.github/actions/install-deps` with `ensure-native-deps: "true"`, which properly calls the native setup action.

## Impact

- ✅ `pngquant-bin` will now build successfully in CI environments
- ✅ Performance monitoring workflow captures accurate install timings
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing

- Local verification: `pnpm lint` passes
- Recommended: Trigger Performance Monitoring workflow to validate end-to-end
- Note: Existing test/build failures are unrelated to these CI infrastructure changes

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to trigger CI validation
2. Monitor first few CI runs to confirm `pngquant-bin` builds without errors
3. Remove this documentation file once changes are verified in production
